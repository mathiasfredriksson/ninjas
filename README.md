# 1337 

Frontend for listing of 1337 staff. 

The goal of this repository was to use React as view library, graphQL for fetching data, and sass for styling. Jest was supposed to be used for testing. 

I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to implement a graphQl client using typescript, and to enable infinity scrolling using a graphQL query.

Webpack is used as bundler, but parcel would be a good alternative. A .dev and a .prod env file is used to toggle localhost development.
